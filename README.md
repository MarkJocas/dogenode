## Usage üíª
You can build and run the docker image using Makefile included.

- make build - builds the docker image locally based on Ubuntu 20.04 with dogecoin version specified at the top of the Makefile.
- make run - runs the image locally mounting your ~/.dogecoin directory and restarting the docker until it is explicitly being shut down.

You might want to download the blockchain snapshot via torrent or a bootstrap.dat to ~/.dogecoin in order to prevent the slow download of the complete blockchain.
